## Reporting extracts: EIOPA Taxonomy Licence Agreement

Copyright EIOPA. Source: the freely available
[supervisory reporting DPM and XBRL materials](https://www.eiopa.europa.eu/tools-and-data/supervisory-reporting-dpm-and-xbrl_en).
Bundled JSON/XZ resources are modified extracts, not official EIOPA release
files. Modification date: 2026-10-06. Changes: selection from database, workbook
and XML sources, normalized identifiers and JSON serialization, losslessly
recompressed with XZ for the native R package. Original hashes are retained.

The complete applicable Taxonomy Licence Agreement version 1.4 (07/10/2025) is
included in `licenses/EIOPA_DPM_TAXONOMY_LICENSE_1_4.txt`.
It permits redistribution and software embedding on its stated conditions.
Preserve the license, attribution and dated change notices when redistributing.
Its derivative-register, license-back and information-on-request provisions
continue to apply. `THIRD_PARTY_DATA_REGISTER.json` identifies the source archives,
changes and bundled derivatives by SHA-256; update it when modifying these data.
The software and separately licensed reporting data remain distinct components.

## Synthetic market examples and user inputs

The included market grids, dates and reference calculations are invented
demonstrations by RiskDataScience GmbH, licensed GPL-3.0-or-later. They do not
contain observed spot curves, provider credit tables or historical market
snapshots. Their independent arithmetic recipe is included in the data file.
`SYNTHETIC_DEMO` labels and runtime warnings identify calculations using them.

Users load their own production inputs from local files. The software performs
no downloads and grants no rights to third-party data supplied by users.
Keep such inputs outside the public source tree and distribute them only under
the applicable data-owner license. See the installed `documentation/DATA.md`.

R dependencies are separately installed, not vendored. No SciPy or Python
runtime is included or required.
